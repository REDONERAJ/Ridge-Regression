# Ridge-Regression
Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that adds an L2 regularization term to the loss function. This penalty reduces the magnitude of coefficients, helping prevent overfitting and handling multicollinearity. The regularization strength is controlled by a parameter alpha.
